  text: '"The Zummit AI/ML Internship was truly an eye-opening experience, they had the right balance between learning and actual work- experience, from the first set of purposefully curated tasks which we had to go through which would, depending on your level either serve as a refresher or as a guide on the basic technologies in use in the machine learning industry, to the monthly Paper Review that always pushes the interns to work together and read on new interesting technologies then try and implement them and propose possible areas in which they can be applied. The introduction into a work environment with daily standups where everyone is able to provide a recap of what they were able to do during the day and air out any issues or blockers they might be facing, and most importantly/fulfilling for me has been the opportunity to work on real-life projects that provide actual value to customers, so having to learn how to keep up with deadlines and deliverables, while working as part of a group and having to report back to a superior. This has really been a really great work learning experience that has no doubt impacted my career trajectory in a positive way."'
